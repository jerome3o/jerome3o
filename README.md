- 👋 Hi, I’m @jerome3o
- 👀 I’m currently interested in philosopy, art, EEG, RTL-SDR, wasm, machine learning, and almost anything cool and new in software and tech.
- 🧠 I know a lot about python based data analysis, rockets, and how to glue a few Raspberry Pi's together to make a fun project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about WASM, and RF engineering for fun.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something that enables positive social change using new technology.
- 📫 How to reach me - here? Is there messaging on github?
